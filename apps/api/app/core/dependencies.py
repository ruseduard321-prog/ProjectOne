"""Dependency injection wiring.

Every service reaches a router through this module. Services are constructed
per request from declared dependencies -- no module-level singletons, no
service locator, no hidden global state (CLAUDE.md 12).

The indirection looks redundant with one service. It is not: it is the seam
that lets tests override a dependency via `app.dependency_overrides` instead of
monkey-patching imports, and it keeps the wiring in one readable place as the
service count grows.
